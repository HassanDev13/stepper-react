# Stepper Component with Shadcn

This project implements a stepper component using [Shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/) and is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com). The stepper allows users to navigate through multiple steps in a form-like interface. 

## Demo

Check out the live demo: [View Demo](https://stepper-react.vercel.app/)

## Technologies Used

- [Shadcn](https://shadcn.dev/) for UI components
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployment
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for building the component
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling

## Future Improvements

Here are some features and improvements planned for future updates:

- **Vertical Stepper**: Currently, the stepper is horizontal. A vertical version is planned to allow for more flexibility in UI design.
- **Step Validation**: Implement step validation logic to ensure users complete required fields before moving to the next step.

Feel free to open issues or contribute to these improvements!
